# We're doing our best

We're in a wild position. Yakov on the walkway of the airship with Elena. Kleb right by the enterance to the airship walkway. Leo somewhere. Inessa on the ship with Dimitri.

Yakov just shot Ashvani, who's with some guards who are fighting because Kleb channeled rage into them. There are Eboran mercenaries coming from the other direction.
