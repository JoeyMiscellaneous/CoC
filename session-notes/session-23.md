# We're doing our best

We're in a wild position. Yakov on the walkway of the airship with Elena. Kleb right by the enterance to the airship walkway. Leo somewhere. Inessa on the ship with Dimitri.

Yakov just shot Ashvani, who's with some guards who are fighting because Kleb channeled rage into them. There are Eboran mercenaries coming from the other direction.

Cesere threw a strange cylinder. Exploded purplish, caused silence and seemed to have an effect on magic folks.

Athenatoi moved into position to protect Ashvani, knocking Kleb.

V and Malik ignore Leo. He goes into the armory and gets a gun and some medical supplies. Goes back into the courtyard, and saw Ashvani but all weird. Stretched long and with extended fingernails.

Battle rages on. Ashvani stood and shook off what happened to him, reverted somewhat to looking more normal. Said he needed to go to the engine facility room to get additional weapons.

Soldiers let an effective volley off.

On board the ship, Inessa gets shot in the face. Fire has spread from the other buildings

Cesere popped out from a corner and started throwing knives but to no avail.

Leo passed Ashvani, threw chalk into his face, and barred him from the engine room. Pressure is building.

Olman grabbed two box covers from crates and held them up as cover.

Kleb talked to a big chromatic shark in his subconscious.

Leo grabs crazy items from below in that weird area. Found a crazy spyglass that can see another dimension and a single crazy rune-inscribed bullet. It was cold. There were also inert rods that showed up through the other dimension spyglass, along with the bullet.

Ashvani says the room is going to explode.

Soldiers hit Olman who drops Kleb.

Elena finishes off the Athenatoi.

Leo shoots Ashvani in the chest with the crazy bullet, which trap him in spectral chains. He uses mind powers to trap Leo in place, saying "If this is to be my tomb, let it be ours."

Elena shows up to kill Ashvani which knocks Leo out of his grasp, they both dip out.

Natalia is down, Leo picks her up.

V and Malik have come to our side now.

In the area there's green and the smell of new growth. There are no soldiers remaining. The new growth suppresses some of the fire. Cesere is shooting at Yakov, who is covered in vines with eyes growing green. He's advancing on Olman, and cleaves into him with the polearm.

We view him through the eyeglass, seeing that he's a giant creature being held up by countless human figures.

The reactor room explodes. Cesere is unsuccessful in shutting Yakov's beast mode down. Elena tries to attack Yakov but he hits her and knocks her down.

Inessa seems to snap Yakov out of it some and then Cesere hits him and knocks him unconscious.

Leo stabilizes Kleb.

The trees by the entrance shake. It's Ashvani, looking super vampiric.

Steamroom explodes into a purple void. It's time to go.
