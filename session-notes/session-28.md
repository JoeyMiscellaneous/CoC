Cesere and Kleb are descending. Inessa is ascending with V and Malik. They had entered a cave with a pit that led down. It blew hot air out of it.

We talk about who to go after. Probably the Krasnovs?

We talk to V and Malik about the significance of this place. Ashvani thought this place was part of a complex plan to release magic into the world, and through its undoing we could prevent monster occurences. Cesere is carrying a lot of books around he got from the ship. He says that understanding this place is paramount.

We also discuss going downwards to the people underground. Malik demonstrates the importance of getting everyone together first.

We head up the tower to a window. Inessa gets her bearings. The camp she saw when coming in is certainly occupied. There's smoke coming out of a chimney which is odd because it's warm here. There are also a few forms on the beach area -- 2 people. The beach is south east of us, the village is south. A large cloud of birds comes up.

Having seen those 2 people, who are planted down near where Leo went down, we decide to collect them before going after the Krasnovs.

Inessa does recognize one of the symbols on one of the tomes in the library. It's the symbol of a rising sun -- identical to the Sons of New Dawn. There are a number of other symbols in there too -- sword, flower, a crown, a key, harp, rising sun, moon, star, crossroads in a circle of some sort. And we can tell from the wall that the boxes are clustered by that symbol.

TODO: Probably worthwhile to try to match these up...

It's not uncommon for revolutionary groups to embrace ancient symbology...but why? And they clearly haven't been here because of how much of an odyssey it was to get here.

We also hear the voices that I heard before repeating from within the fallen tower. We put a pin in that.

We go to find Yakov and Leo. We see a couple figures drawing in the sand at a distance. We make out that they're Leo and Yakov, and walk over to them.

There's a strange symbol in Yakov's head, Krillin style. Circle, jagged line in the middle, 3 dots on either side of the line forming 6 total. Shirtless, has a picture of a tree stump tattooed on his chest. That's new. They made new friends. They're Lahn Pa. Bargained their freedom in exchange for killing the Sons of New Dawn.

Figure out that there's a resemblence between Chot the Leveler and the dude in the top of the tower. That's *really* a fucking head trip for Kleb, Jesus.

The Lahn Pa also said that the SoND camp is near the tower. We think it's to the south of the tower.

Inessa and Leo and Yakov have also seen giant chamelions. And Yakov found God's children. A giant serpent, hundreds of feet in length. Yakov killed it but doesn't remember great. He thinks he spawned a giant cage around it, which then drowned the serpent.

The tattoos that they gave Yakov say they help him, and made him "unbound". Also apparently showing him a mirror (his own reflection) halted Yakov in his intense state.

Yakov also *does* recognize all the ruins. And they let him keep a Rosetta stone dictionary.

Also, when the chief sat in the throne there was a weird resonance in the air. And it's well guarded. We've been tasked with going and killing all the Sons of New Dawn.

There is also the wreckage of another ship that crashed. Not a SoND ring. It's a symbol of a hammer and sword, crossed. He hands it around.

The ring triggers a memory for Leo, when he was working for his uncle. Visited an embassador from across the sea -- Isenbrau, to the west. That place had just begun making contact with the Saberania. That person had a ring with the same sigil. Theoretically, Isenbrau is one of the more militaristic empires that exists. They've been constantly at war with minor kingdoms for a long time. Respond best to demonstrations of strength. Major supplier of natural resources to the Saberania.

Malik expresses that he doesn't necessarily want to kill all the SoND folks...and we agree, we're just try'na grab the Krasnovs and find more info.

Into the jungle we go! We navigate pretty well, although we aren't super low profile. We disturb several clusters of birds - strange boneline raven forms, with exoskeletons kinda.

Find the trace of some left-behind parachutes. No bodies, find some tracks leading toward the camp kinda. Looked like just 4ish.

Cesere makes his way off into the woods to just kinda look and check things out. After a few minutes he returns. "It's a little larger than we thought. At least 25 people there. Well armed, well equiped. Small arms and some larger equipment. No sign of the Krasnovs, or any building that looked like a prison. Did see a number of folks who looked to be officers discussing / planning something. Also a number of artifacts, same writing as the tables from the tower, assembled. They're doing some sort of review."

These SoND folks were more like rugged individuals vs a military camp.

We venture through the jungle some. Inessa checks some stuff out.

These SoND uniforms all have patches on the right arm, with a symbol of a fox curling on its tail. Inessa remembers all the times her dad called her his little fox. Definitely told her lots of stories about foxes.

We continue into the woods, but Yakov quickly realizes that he's lost the trail. It's the beginning of sunset. We decide to find some shelter.

Inessa gets us fuuuull lost in the woods. It's *probably* the one that we went to before...I think it's the wrong one though actually. A cave is a cave, though. Hot gust of wind coming up to hit us...possibly a passageway to below?

The hot air comes at fixed intervals. In between them, there's a sound almost like a whine far, far down.

No stairs, natural cave.

We split into watches. No fire, it's warm.
