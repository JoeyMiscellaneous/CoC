## First they were tested

I wake abruptly, in the thick of mist, to Polochev asking for my help
    - Struggle the steer the ship straight
    - I have to stay strong and hold fast
    - We cut speed and try to have faith
    - The mist is odd...clinging and unsettling
    - there is an abrupt, grinding and clanging sound
Now we're drifting
    - Polachev tries to fix the engine and we drop anchor
    - Hoping we don't get swung into the cliffsides
    - Inessa goes to check on the coffin, and Kleb wakes
    - Mist can be a concealment sent by God (Aii) to obscure things (maybe we should embrace it?)
The current and the wind push and pull us around
    - The wind can't dispel the mist
    - Engine is back up and now we're steering through to the end of the canyon
    - We cut through the mist and make our way up an incline to exit the canyon, and now everything is mist
    - In front of us is a wrecked river boat, and as the mist begins to burn off we see that our path is blocked by this near crash.
    - We struggle to shore to look for the cargo and any survivors
There's a lot of blood but no corpses
    - Crates seem to be raided
    - In one crate is a large amount of sedatives (morphine)
    - The boat is gashed in multiple places and Yakov tumbles into the water
More blood on the deck towards the aft cabin
    - There is a body in the cabin, and everything is in disarray
    - His head is thrown into the wall and he is very dead
    - In his personal chest is a bunch of letters to:
        - Nayan - Agriculture
        - Aros
        - Bes
        - Jom
        - And other saints like:
            - Sokh
    - He also has a book with a really weird texture
    - I open the letter marked Jom, inside is a lithograph of an unknown person attached to a tarot card of the saint (Jom)
    - The rest are all similar, but some are crossed out, including Anastasiya on the card of Nayan the Cultivator. The other is on the card of the falconer Daga with another unknown face
    - The position of the photos also changes based on the valence of the card (positive or negative)
    - Several important locations are designated on the map, one closer to the Krasnovs and one by the Orlovs.
    - Several points on the map in between are marked with "x's"
    - I take everything and the weird book
    - Polachev says they haven't found anybody yet and wants to search for his fellow union workers
    - After looking at the cards, Kleb realizes that the Daga card is that of Ivan Krasnov, the father of the current patriarch
        - [Daga is the] Judge of right and wrong, sees the truest
    - Some people on the cards seem like they aren't from the Saberaniya
    - One Lungpa person is in the weal position, who is on Chot the Leveler
- We head into the woods, prepared to search for the survivors
    - All loaded and ready to go
    - We start out following the blood trail and disturbances, but then the tracks start to disappear as we approach an icy lake
    - The tracks diverge between large paw prints and the human tracks
    - We debate how to proceed
    - We follow the tracks east, the rough direction of Ceder Crest
    - Some ways away, Inessa points out a disguised human on the ridge
    - Kleb and Inessa move to the clumps
    - Dimitri comes out with a revolver
