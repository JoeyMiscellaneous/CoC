# Context

We're floating toward Iktash.

We have a team of engineers who are very upset with us because we contributed to killing their families.

We let a guy die who was just in a closet and disposed of his body. He had a duster coat, and a letter of admition to the house of wisdom.

We have Dimitri near the end of his rope. For 3 days he just steered. Now we have someone who can steer a little.

Olman is recovering. Yakov is somewhat unstable. He's developed some skills, but he also triggered his stuff during.

Natalia wants to dispose of Yakov hardcore. Elena has some complex feelings about him. Cesere sees the seeming need about keeping him.

V and Malik are great allies. They're diametrically opposed on the magic stuff to Cesere. They think opening all the seals will be good.

We have some disagreement about what to do next.

We reviewed the dossiers. Cesere's dossier has some interesting stuff in it...did some terrorism. Has some abilities.

We plunge into some weird mist.

Monotheistic cultures treat "monsters" pretty differently than polytheistic ones. Think about the story of the princess -- there are "monsters" in it that are also to some seen as protectors.

# Session 26. Gravity.

## We may have made a mistake

"The forest was burning, but the trees kept yearning for the axe."

## The ship begins to fall

The metal on the walls is starting to heat up.

I look through the telescope and am blinded by the seal, which is huge. We're right over it, and it's bright and has tendrils coming off of it. I head toward the engineers.

Leo looks for stuff marked "In case of emergency". There are emergency boxes -- there's something that he doesn't recognize in them. A sort of "In case of fire, use this" and it's a backpack full of cloth. There are 2.

V, at first, assists Dimitri in righting the ship. And then, seeing that it isn't effective, runs deeper into the ship. And makes eye contact with Malik as he does so.

Malik runs to the office. He comes out a moment later and says "I'm going to find my way to the engine room, see if I can do anything."

Yakov is trapped in a small room by himself, being buffeted by fragments of broken boxes. He has a lot of molten metal at his disposal. He bodyslams the door -- no budge. He punches through the window, but can't spin the circular handle to the door. He grabs a longer piece of metal that "grew" during his episode.

The sounds of clanging metal ring out. Elena and Natalia do some indistinct yelling. Inessa moves towards it. Olman is awake, and talking them through strapping him to the bed and detaching it so it can be used as a gurney. He knows we're falling, and says "It's better to be out of the ship than in it when falling."

Olman throws out: The only thing on this thing that floats is the balloon. If we're on top, we won't sink...we can climb. Olman also says "You have to leave me here" to Natalia. Insists, actually.

Kleb's idea to make the engine super hot doesn't work...but there are escape hatches. He frees all the engineers, who move to the escape hatches. He then goes to free Yakov.

Leo and V find a lot of parachutes, and start going to distribute them.

The folks on the lower level hear the sound of breaking glass. It's Cesere. The engine whines and gets louder.

Inessa convinces Elena to leave. Natalia won't leave. Leo gives Inessa and Elena parachutes. They go downstairs looking for parachutes. One of the lockers only has one in it. Inessa grabs it, and starts looking at the other door, where she finds 1 more.

Elena starts bringing the chutes to her parents. Elena moves toward Yakov's room and doesn't notice shit because the engine is being super loud.

A bunch of the engineers run back into the room where they were locked. The others punch me some, and tie my hands behind my back.

I try to escape them, it doesn't work.

Leo and Malik have a quick convo, Leo gives him a parachute.

Cesere comes out of the library with a couple bags of books and a backpack on. He sees everyone, and says a zinger no one can hear over the sound of the engine. Drops the books, jumps into the fray. He pulls the guys off me so I'm no longer restrained, and helps me to my feet.

Yakov gets the door open, and crawls up and out of it because the ship is leaned such that the door is on the ceiling. Then he climbs into the cabin with us. Then he does shock damage to everyone around him excluding me and Cesere, swirling this metal piece.

The engineer opens the door to the outside, and the door and engineer are both sucked out.

I go to the deck. V and Dimitri are trying to stabilize the ship. Leo is also there. He notices a ton of stuff.

We're caught in the winds of a caldera. There's a jungle-like landscape that surrounds it, and a bunch of ruins, and one standing tower. There's also a lot of other random buildings. 
Leo searches Ashvani's office for a parachute and doesn't find one.

We have 2 turns to get out.

Vladimir has another chute, which he gives to Leo. Then he tries to hold the wheel down.

Malik comes down the stairs and sees Yakov. He's got a pack on. He comes up and says "We need to get you some chutes. Follow me!". And he heads back up.

Cesere gets the books, and then makes his way up to get a chute.

Yakov hoofs it to the top of the stairs with Kleb.

Elena and Natalia drag Olman out and Kleb and Yakov see them, all with parachutes. She moves to open one of the doors to the outside. The door opens. Natalia tries to drag Olman out which doesn't work.

Inessa tries to go get her stuff from her room which is across the hall. She's quick as fuck. She takes a strain, but makes it to her room, grabs her bag and her rifle.

Engineers are out.

Dimitri lets go of the wheel, Vladimir still holding. He sprints to the door, grabs his father, and prepares to help them jump out.

Kleb blurs, connecting to the text of the book he read about augury through mist and glides through to Leo, grabs him, and glides him back despite the ship twisting and turning.

Yakov and Cesere get parachutes, Kleb is going to grab Cesere.

Leo calls out "We're jumping!".

The door is sucked open. It spins. Mist, sun, mist, sun as it spins.

Leo jumps.

Vladimir lets go of the wheel. The ship lurches and spins. He runs up the deck to one of the doorways but doesn't quite make it. Malik tries to catch him, and succeeds. The two of them try to jump out together.

Kleb and Cesere cling together, Cesere rolls a 10, and we hurl ourselves out of the door.

Yakov barely successfully throws himself out of the airship.

Elena, Natalia, Olman, and Dimitria -- the flying Krasnovs -- all get sucked out of the open door as the ship spins.

Inessa understands the tempo of the ship's movement, slides down and out of the door the Krasnovs left through, and into the air.

Leo pulls his chute immediately.

Note: The water is hot, potentially scalding, but not boiling. There's also less steam coming from over the caldera than there was in the seal barrier, which doesn't make a lot of sense.

The Krasnovs get Olman's parachute open, and they all land near the jungle.

Inessa hella notices where everyone goes and makes a mental note.

Kleb tries to spin himself off toward Inessa and V but ends up just going toward the ruins.

Leo pulled his chute early, and is falling considerably slower. He rolls over his luck, and manifests himself to go over land. Which works. He touches down right on the beach.

V and Malik disappear into the jungle.

Yakov is doing a luck roll as well, which he fails. He rolls a 3 too...his parachute half deploys, so he's buffeted by the wind but it pulls him deeper over the water. It eventually opens some more but he lands in the water. It's hot and deep. He's submerged. Also very clear, and as he dips below the surface he sees an entire ruined city below the water. Buildings with plants and whatnot, weird fish flowing between them. Not carp. Unidentified fish. Warm enough to be uncomfortable but not hot enough to be fatal.

He unbuckles the chute / anchor strapped to him and tries to swim back to the shore.

Inessa makes a mental map of everything and then lands near where V and Malik were in the jungle.
