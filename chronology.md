Ruins + Tree under Ceder Crest | Book of Saints | Revolution in Zakanchiva.

War.

Lear, Cesere, Dimitri, Anastasia meet.

Sons of New Dawn were in Koutin's Crossing and possibly already in Coutin's Crossing.

Anastasia Death.

Lev sends telegram.

Investigation.

Kleb finds symbol across from body, scratched into building. Same symbol that Yakov reveals much later to be over the city in fog.

Blood on the couch in the meeting room after the Leer, Cesere, Viktor, Anastasia meeting.

Meet with the mayor. He acts suspicious. He gives us a suspicious letter, we open it and find a secret message for the union leader to watch for the soldier of fortune AKA Cesere.

Hands Crossed Axe to Ofelya.

Head up river, find Dimitri's boat. Find the tarot card / lithograph things and a gun and a shark skin journal which is locked.

While on the boat, we find that it's full of very modern, high tech guns from Khyrkhult.

Find wolf tracks, follow them into the woods, find Dimitri. Get back to the boat, fight over objects, eventually return them to him. 

We fight a motherfucking ghost wolf. It bleeds cummy blood. For a brief moment the wolf's eyes turn blue and human seeming. It took Dimitri's bag.

Have a heart to heart with Dimitri.

I teach everyone drums and basketball and make friends with Polechev and Moegev. I hit a fucking Curry-to-beat-the-French dagger 3 of a molotov cocktail to torch the other boat. The devil named Kleb is hurting us, say the boat / French.

Get to Ceder Crest. The mill is closed. We meet Mirolev the priest and the steward Lev (no relation).

We talk to Maz Ivan about tools that went missing on the brief walk from the dock to the mill.

While investigating the tools, we see bulletin board postings about the strike, one about joining the guard, and one about the Sons of New Dawn expedition into the mountain.

We head in and meet a few of the Krasnovs. Ludmila the sister and Natalia the mother and Elena the other, militant sister.

We learn Dimitri and Anastasia's meeting with the Coutin's Crossing mayor wasn't known to their father.

Sons of New Dawn are definitely in Ceder Crest by now.

During the day, we go to Anastasia and Dimitri's old workshop. We find a manuscript of cultivation, a picture of Anastasia, two gold bars, and some art of Anastasia but with blue eyes.

We go to the tavern that night. Tried to go upstairs when everyone was meeting, got turned away at the top. Altercation with Elena. Talks mad shit, accuses you of murdering Anastasia. Inessa gets smashes to smithereens. The group finds her, she comes out to Kleb.

Cesere shows up in a dark corner of the room we're in. Meets us, tells us about the Sons of New Dawn just a bit. Does not like those fuckers. We murder board a bit.

There's a letter slipped under the door that is an invitation to the Sons of New Dawn's meeting on that same second floor of the tavern. That's the same symbol on Inessa's ring, which she got from her father.

We give Cesere the writ to get damning evidence saying Lev is doing fuck shit.

The following day, funeral procession. Dimitri gives us the slip, leaves a very rude note. We're invited to go with the procession, and decline in favor of solving Ana's murder. We find Cesere and really fuck his shit up. He shaves to be better hidden after.

The captain buries Anastasia.

Attend Sons of New Dawn party. Inessa hears unverified gossip. We meet V, and Malik the guard of Ashvani who has a weird and silky and slightly cummy shoulder, reminiscent of ghost wolf blood.

The scientists, Natalia, Amiela, and Siva, are very interested in Yakov's blood.

I learn that the scientists are trying to harness energy "from the other side".

Kane Lier, Lev, and Laren Sikilov are seen leaving a meeting room.

I talk to Lev for a bit, we set up a time to talk to him about the murder.

Leo talks Kane Lier, who tries to contract him.

Dimitri is seen leaving a meeting with two folks in nationalist outfits. We ask him why he's doing shit here instead of burying his sister. He says there's more important things to be done. Notably not wearing a Sons of New Dawn ring. Tells us that he suspects that someone in the Sons of New Dawn is behind or affiliated with his sister's death. He's currently trying to buy Ceder Crest's safety when the Nationalists win, in exchange for cutting the telegraph wires at Coutin's Crossing.

Tells us about Ana's powers as a wraith walker. She channels the power of the Cultivator. Their whole family knew about it.

Next morning, Yakov gives his blood to Ashvani the scientist. We also learn that Cesere is caught. Lev was "forewarned about it", by our letter warning of the Soldier of Fortune.

Dimitri says we need to try to get Cesere out.

He tells us then about the catacombs. 

We go in and talk to Cesere, get the ledger paper on Lev and the writ back. Also find the armory basement that we think connects to the basement.

We find from the ledger paper a list of what Lev was transacting and who he was talking to:
    - Mentions TA, likely Taimir Arsat
    - OF, likely Ofelya, then AN crossed out, likely Inessa's dad Alexander Nasanov
    - Mentions OB, likely Ogi Byrellin, as go between
    - Keeping OK, likely Olman Krasnov, at a distance
    - Keep DK, likely Dimitri, distracted. No more games.
    - Wire to BOKC, likely Bank of Koutin's Crossing.
    - Cash for UB, not sure who that is. Possibly union boss.
    - SOF, soldier of fortune, keep a lookout
    - Increase security

Dimitri tells us about the tarot cards. Says it shows who carries on the bloodlines of the saints, and when those people die via the X's on them. For instance, Ana's image which had an X is starting to fade and will be replaced when another is born. But Ivan's is still fully visible with no X, because he's being kept alive in some fashion that Dimitri refuses to elaborate on.

Spent a long fucking time if we should rescue him. Landed on yes. Then lots of stuff on how to get Cesere out. Determined we needed to A team him.

Once we have our plan, we go to the catacombs to find where it meets the citadal.

That morning before we go to the catacomb enterance, the owner of the general store tells us that the militia is heading down river toward Koutin's Crossing.

Kleb is mad anxious in the catacombs. We venture from a natural cavern deeper in, until there's smooth walls. It smells of ozone and decay, and also the smell of forest / spring.

There's, in one corner alcove of the hallway, a 4 armed statue. Each hand is holding a sword, a drum mallet, a key, and a whip. It has a mosaic backsplash, and sort of a scene with the wall. And it's unnervingly detailed. Some tomb raidering occurs, and we find a room behind it. Pull it out from the wall to reveal a passage.

In the room, there's an image of soldiers fighting a winged beast and two sarcophagi. The images are incredibly lifelike, like they were liquid and then suddenly frozen.

When Yakov enter's the room the images start to glow. There are symbols like we saw in the old book that hum and glow.

To clarify: The two sarcophagi are on either side of the relief in the middle, which is what drank the blood. And later it drops away and reveals stairs downwards.

Dimitri says we should go. Yakov puts his hand in the the thing and immediately becomes unresponsive. It stabs his hand and starts pooling all his blood. It flows out and covers the image that we saw with the sarcophagi. Dimitri freaks out. I break open the thing holding his hand, and Leo starts healing him.

Colors start to sharpen around Yakov. His eyes are shining blue. Meanwhile, Yakov is having an out of body experience with Anastasia.

Literally all Yakov says is "She says sorry." Harry Potter ass pronoun bullshit fuck outta here.

We move down the hallway. The walls are glowing, showing endless cyclical war between men and men, men and beasts.

We see one small room with nine statues arrayed in sequence. I see the statue of Sokh with my old mentor's face on it briefly. The same happens for Inessa with Ana on the Cultivator's statue.

The opposite room has a big fuckoff tree in it, from the floor to the ceiling, the window to the wall. We put a pin in that.

We eventually reach newer stone, where the floor looks similar to the armory. We hear the sound of voices and metal on metal, like might happen in an armory. We stop and listen, then chip away at the morter. Dimitri is gone. Apparently he's fucked off. Last we've seen him was dragging Yakov out.

Yakov talks about his conversation with Ana. Says "She wants us to stop solving her murder, and we need to stop the Sons of New Dawn". Yakov is like "Bet."

He also mentions that he's being pulled toward the tree room, and I feel that as well despite trying to put it out of my mind. It notably feels different for each of us. For Yakov it's like trying to get a harmonic resolution, for Inessa it's fascination.

There's a hum from the runes as Yakov nears them, by the way.

We head to the tree room. There we find some interesting things. We see the same rune from the drain pipe and above the town, and determine that from that point to the symbol we see in the floor in that room forms a map. We think they're places of power in a nonagon.

Overlay it with a map and we see 9 places of power.

Instead of battle on the walls in this room there are the journeys of 9 individuals, the saints. They trek into the mountains, and eventually meet together and clasp hands. The image created by their overlapping limbs is the symbol on the floor in this room. This tree is one of these places.

Dimitri comes back.

On our way back out, we see the room where Yakov bled. The pooling blood has moved the image and revealed a staircase. We don't go down it.

We leave, and decide to split up the gang.

Dimitri tells us about a cool boat, and Yakov goes with because he's lost a lot of blood.

The other three go to the great house. Inessa is to distract Lev, Kleb and Leo are to get Cesere out of the armory.

As we get there we see Doctor Ashvani are leaving Ceder Crest, like they know shit is going to down.

We go to Lev's office. We chat for a bit, look over his report. We return the writ. Inessa stays and distracts him. Kleb and Leo leave to chat with Cesere.

Cesere is hanging out. Leo convinces the guard to give us a moment alone. We inject him, then immediately Kane Lier comes around the corner and says he needs Leo's help.

Leo pronounces Cesere dead then leaves with Kane. 

At this time, Yakov and Dimitri got the really pretty boat and all our stuff from our room.

Inessa charms the fuck out of Lev, distracts him great. Lev says he doesn't want to see war again. He knew Inessa's dad, and that he supplied the Lynx during the fighting. He wants to protect the Krasnovs because they saved him when he was an orphan.

Kleb, in the basement, gets Cesere's body on the table, then works some youth pastor magic to leave and sit out under the open sky and talk about God. Very genuine because I was talking about my feelings about my sons who died. They're receptive which is so sad because they're probably about to die or lose family members.

Leo walks through the woods until he reaches a bunch of Orlov guys who are armed to the fucking teeth and have lots of artillery. He sees a nationalist he recognizes, and also Dak.

Inessa and Lev hear an explosion. Cesere has blown a fat hole into the armory. Kleb and Inessa leave and go to the opening of the catacombs to meet him.

As they're leaving, artillary hits. We begin running so as not to get trapped. Orlov troops charge.

Gatling guns open up. Leo hits the deck. Then disfigure a corpse to look like him, take his clothes, and run to the docks.

Inessa and Kleb divert and just head to the docks. We wait until Dimitri says we can't wait anymore. Leo shows up in a nationalist uniform, which is sus until he explains.

We man the turret as we're firing at the artillary positions. Then as we start to open up the throttle, we see Cesere running after the boat with his hair on fire. We scoop him up.

We all trade notes, and confirm it's Dak. Cesere explains some stuff about wraith walkers, someone who bridges the two worlds and becomes possessed sometimes.

Wraith walkers are "unreliable companions", per Cesere.

We use Inessa's drawings of the sigils to create a sort of map.

Cesere says he's also from an ancient line, bound to duty but not by the saints. But still bound by blood to merge into the entites of power. Their families are dedicated to keeping the ancient places sealed off. (Which stands to reason if he follows the line of the Aesthetic Virtue). The Saints made sacrifices to separate the other side from the physical world. Before, endless wars raged. They bound them with seals like the ones at the tree we saw.

Cesere says the Sons of New Dawn want to return us to the old state by shattering the sigils.

There was a sigil in Koutin Crossing that's been broken because whatever entity embodied it has been removed. Ostensibly Anastasia.

Ashvani is heading to another sigil spot up in the mountains.

What to do? Link up with Krasnov's? Head to Koutin's Crossing? Go to the mountains to find Olman and stop Ashvani?
