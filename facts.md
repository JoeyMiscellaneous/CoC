10/10
Inessa almost poisoned her family with mushrooms when she was learning how to cook growing up. Now she doesn't cook, she just has other people cook. Also her dad and brother went to the war her dad left her a ring that she wears on her ring finger.

Leo is missing a chunk of his ear from a wound he got in service. Favorite color is yellow and cultivates daisies outside of his house.

Yakov is afraid of horses growing up, but got over it as he started working with them.

Kleb was extremely afraid of horses since one bit him when he was a small boy. He didn't get over that fear until he was 20 and didn't want to act like a coward in front of the woman who would become his wife. He shortly after fell in love both her and horses. Horses, non-romantically though. He also grew 5 inches when he was 13.

Inessa is really good at holding his breath.

Yakov's favorite instrument to listen to is harpsichord.

In Tales of Explorer Coslov #251 he was surrounded by a native tribe. He never got to finish that one.

Kleb in stressful situations usually thinks of his wife, but today he finds himself thinking much more about his son.
