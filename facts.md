# 10/10
Inessa almost poisoned her family with mushrooms when she was learning how to cook growing up. Now she doesn't cook, she just has other people cook. Also her dad and brother went to the war her dad left her a ring that she wears on her ring finger.

Leo is missing a chunk of his ear from a wound he got in service. Favorite color is yellow and cultivates daisies outside of his house.

Yakov is afraid of horses growing up, but got over it as he started working with them.

Kleb was extremely afraid of horses since one bit him when he was a small boy. He didn't get over that fear until he was 20 and didn't want to act like a coward in front of the woman who would become his wife. He shortly after fell in love both her and horses. Horses, non-romantically though. He also grew 5 inches when he was 13.

## Many facts were lost in the great Joey Deleting his WSL Instance Tragedy of June, 2025.

Inessa is really good at holding his breath.

Yakov's favorite instrument to listen to is harpsichord.

In Tales of Explorer Coslov #251 he was surrounded by a native tribe. He never got to finish that one.

Kleb in stressful situations usually thinks of his wife, but today he finds himself thinking much more about his son.

Inessa has never broken a bone, and she's only been shot in the face once.

Yakov misses his family, and the peace and quiet. As he came to consciousness last session, he was meditating on if everything was still and silent.

After making it into the airship, Leo was whispering names to himself. First time he's done something akin to prayer.

Kleb's biggest recurring nightmare is the ground falling away from beneath him.

This sort of outburst is what got Yakov recruited to Dak in the first place.

Despite everything, Leo has not felt the urge to drink this whole time.

Since the giant fish experience, Kleb has felt somewhat more comfortable in water.

Inessa's favorite insect is the humble spider.

# 10/30

Yakov does not celebrate Halloween because it doesn't exist, but if he did he'd hand out potatoes because it's cheaper.

Inessa has a journal where she writes poems, or things that she observes in a book she carries around with her.

The guy Leo let die is making him feel real guilty.

Kleb is usually little spoon and falls asleep with his wife's hand on his stomach. Since leaving, he's had his own hand on his stomach there when he falls asleep. He has not realized it.

# 12/12

Kleb is sort of in crisis about power.
